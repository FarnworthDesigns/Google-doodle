# My Topic Google Doodle

My topic for Google Doodle is "International Astronomy Day". International Astronomy Day is a way for astronomy enthusiasts and professionals to share their knowledge and love of outer space with the general public. It is also a way for everyone interested in space to explore their passion and increase their knowledge.
